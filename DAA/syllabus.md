## Design and Analysis of Algorithms
### Module 1: Introduction
Characteristics of algorithm. Analysis of algorithm: Asymptotic analysis of complexity bounds – best, average and worst-case behavior; Performance measurements of Algorithm, Time and space trade-offs, Analysis of recursive algorithms through recurrence relations: Substitution method, Recursion tree method and Masters’ theorem.

### Module 2: Fundamental Algorithmic Strategies
Brute-Force, Greedy,Dynamic Programming, Branch- and-Bound and Backtracking methodologies for the design of algorithms; Illustrations of these techniques for Problem-Solving: Bin Packing, Knap Sack, TSP.

### Module 3: Graph and Tree Algorithms
Traversal algorithms: Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS); Shortest path algorithms, Transitive closure, Minimum Spanning Tree, Topological sorting, Network Flow Algorithm.

### Module 4: Tractable and Intractable Problems
Computability of Algorithms, Computability classes – P, NP, NP-complete and NP-hard. Cook’s theorem, Standard NP-complete problems and Reduction techniques.

### Module 5: Advanced Topics
Approximation algorithms, Randomized algorithms, Heuristics and their characteristics.

### Course Outcomes:
The student will be able to:
1. For a given algorithms analyze worst-case running times of algorithms based on asymptotic analysis and justify the correctness of algorithms;
2. Explain when an algorithmic design situation calls for which design paradigm (greedy/ divide and conquer/backtrack etc.);
3. Explain model for a given engineering problem, using tree or graph, and writethe corresponding algorithm to solve the problems;
4. Demonstrate the ways to analyze approximation/randomized algorithms (expected running time, probability of error); &
5. Examine the necessity for NP class based problems and explain the use of heuristic techniques.
